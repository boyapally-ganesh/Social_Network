#### Endpoint: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/friend-request/
#### Header: Authorization: Bearer {token}
#### Body:

```bash
#### Send Friend Request

- **GET Method:**
  - **Endpoint:** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/friend-request/`
  - **Header:** Authorization: Bearer {token}
  - **Description:** Retrieves a list of all users. This can be used to display potential friends to send requests to.

- **POST Method:**
  - **Endpoint:** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/friend-request/`
  - **Header:** Authorization: Bearer {token}
  - **Body:**
    ```json
    {
      "receiver": 16
    }
    ```
  - **Description:** Sends a friend request to another user by specifying the receiver's user ID.

### Usage Tips
- For the GET method, ensure you are authorized (using the token) to fetch the list of users.
- For the POST method, replace `"receiver": 16` with the actual user ID of the person you wish to send a friend request to.
- Check the response status and data for each request to understand how the API processes it.

This setup allows users to first find potential friends using the GET method and then initiate friend requests using the POST method.

```
